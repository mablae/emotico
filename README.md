# Emotico - A SMS / MMS / Whatsapp  Messanger Project

## What is this ?

This is a development or(/and) production environment for PHP built in seperate docker containers, managed with docker-compose. The basic setup contains a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, RabbitMQ and PHP)

On this LAMP Stack a Symfony 3 App is living

(MySQL is replaced by a MariaDB instance which is technically the same as MySQL, but with extra features and promises too be faster than MySQL)

## What's inside:
 * Nginx
 * PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0, both contain:
    * APCu (optional)
    * XDebug (optional)
    * Production/development config (optional)
    * Wkhtmltopdf
    * Wkhtmltoimage
    * Composer
    * PHPUnit
    * Phing/Ant
    * ...
 * MariaDB
 * Automated backups
 * Redis
 * RabbitMQ

## Documentation

### Requirements

Make sure you have installed `docker` and `docker-compose`. Both are easily installed via:


Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
   
Docker compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Makefile

In the root of the project there is a `Makefile`, if you are using an OS that support it, a lot of commands explained below can be ran easily trough the makefile as a shortcut. If you don't support the Makefile you can find each command inside this file. (Variables are defined at the top).

Useful commands:
    
    # Pull all the newest images
    pull
    # Start development environment. Will recreate linked containers of new services, using compose-up-development.yml
    up_dev
    # The same as up_dev but then for your production environment, using compose-up-production.yml
    up_prod
    # Create a backup of the shared containers data in data/backups/
    backup_container_data
    # Create a backup of the MariaDB instance in data/backups/
    backup_database
    # Create a backup of the wwwdata container volum in data/backups/
    backup_www
    # Reload PHP FPM of the php56 service
    reload_php_56
    # Reload PHP FPM of the php70 service
    reload_php_70:
    # Reload the nginx configuration files (service nginx reload)
    reload_nginx:
	
	# Connect to different containers. (Create a bash shell session inside a container)
	connect_backup	
	connect_mailcatcher
	connect_mariadb
	connect_nginx
	connect_php56
	connect_php70
	connect_rabbitmq
	connect_redis
	connect_wwwdata

Commands for building and developing the services:

    # Stop and remove all containers shown by 'docker ps -a'
    clear_containers
    # Remove all stored images shown by 'docker images'
    clear_images
    # Will run both 'clear_containers' and 'clear_images"
    clear_all
    # Use the compose build file to build all containers, even unused containers for specific environments
    build

### Launching containers

The entire collection of containers is built to run as a development environment and (or) a production environment. The files `compose-up-development.yml` and `compose-up-production.yml` define the configuration for each environment. See https://docs.docker.com/compose/ for more information about a compose configuration file.

You can specify the configuration file with the `-f` flag, which will result in:

    docker-compose -f compose-up-development.yml up
    
OR

    docker-compose -f compose-up-production.yml up
    
When supporting the Makefile you could run:

    make up_dev
    
OR

    make up_production

# Specifying development or production use

Currently there are a few changes that are supported through config files and mounted files.

## PHP56 and PHP70

Both containers support 4 environment variables that can be filled through your compose configuration file:

    # Set this to `true` to enable APCu cache, and to `false` to disable it.
    PHP_APCU_ENABLED: 'false'
    # Set this to `true` to enable XDebug, and to `false` to disable it. Typically enabled only for development
    PHP_XDEBUG_ENABLED: 'true'
    # Set this to `true` to enable mailcatcher, and to `false` to disable it. Typically enabled only for development
    PHP_MAILCATCHER_ENABLED: 'true'
    # Set this to `development` to load the mounted development.ini file, and to `production` to load the mounted production.ini file.
    PHP_ENV: 'development'

When disabling mailcatcher you can remove the mailcatcher service in your compose file, with the links to the mailcatcher service from other services as well (like in the production compose configuration file).
